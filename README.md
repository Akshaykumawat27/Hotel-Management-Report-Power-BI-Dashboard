# Hotel-Management-Report-Power-BI-Dashboard
Project Title: Hotel Management Dashboard

Project Overview: This Power BI project is focused on building a Hotel Management Dashboard that tracks and analyzes key performance metrics for hotel management, including occupancy rates, revenue trends, and booking patterns. The dashboard enables hotel managers to make informed decisions based on weekly, monthly, and quarterly trends, optimizing room utilization and revenue generation.

Key Metrics & Visualizations:

Occupancy Rate Analysis: Visualizes the occupancy rate trend over different time periods (week, month, quarter) to identify patterns and fluctuations.
Total Occupied Rooms: Displays the trend in the number of occupied rooms over weeks, months, and quarters.
Average Daily Rate (ADR): Tracks the trend in the average daily rate (ADR) to monitor and optimize hotel pricing strategies.
Revenue Per Available Room (PAR): Presents the trend of revenue generated per available room, providing insights into overall revenue performance.
Total Bookings Trend: Tracks total bookings and analyzes demand trends to better manage room inventory.
Weekend vs. Weekday Bookings: Compares booking trends between weekends and weekdays, enabling targeted marketing and pricing strategies.
Cancelled Bookings Trend: Visualizes the number of cancelled bookings to identify potential issues and minimize cancellations.
Total Revenue: Tracks the total revenue generated by the hotel, broken down into weeknights and weekend nights.
Total Revenue by Week Bar Chart: Visualizes total revenue by week, with an average revenue line to easily identify high and low-performing weeks.
Total Occupied Rooms by Week Bar Chart: Visualizes total occupied rooms by week, with average occupancy rates to highlight performance.
Skills Used:

Power BI: Data visualization, report building
DAX Functions: Advanced calculations for KPIs and trends
Data Modeling & Cleaning: Using Power Query for clean and organized data
